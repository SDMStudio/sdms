.SH NAME
SDMStudio \- the sequential decision making problem solver.
.SH SYNOPSIS
SDMStudio [--version] [--help] <command> [<args>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
SDMStudio is an efficient solver for games. The solver can be used to solve any kind of sequential decision making problems. Two class of algorithms are available (planning or reinforcement learning).
The first version of SDM'Studio can solve problems like : MDP, POMDP, Dec-POMDP, ZS-POSG, and event more. 

The main two algorithms implemented in the platform are HSVI (for planning field) and Q-learning (for reinforcement learning field). Further informations about the platform can be found on https://gitlab.inria.fr/chroma1/plasma/sdms.
